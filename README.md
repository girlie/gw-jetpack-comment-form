**Thesis Helper Box for Jetpack Comment Form**

_A helper box for integrating Jetpack comments and Thesis._

1. Upload the `.zip` file via Thesis → Boxes → Manage Boxes → Upload Box.
2. Once the box has been uploaded and appears in the list of available boxes, select its checkbox, then click SAVE BOXES.
3. Go to Skin Editor → HTML, and access your Single template for editing.
4. Add the Jetpack Comment Form box to the template, inside the Post Comments box (see note below); then drag it so that it’s just above the current Comment Form box.
5. Using `shift+drag`, remove the original Comment Form box from the template.
6. Save the template.

NOTE: As these instructions are based on the Classic Responsive Skin, the name of this box may be different if you’re using another Skin instead; so you’ll need to adapt accordingly.
